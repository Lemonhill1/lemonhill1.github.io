			<q>This band rips. Blood Banks is a rock n’ roll four-piece from Minneapolis, MN. They formed in 2015 and have released two EP’s. Their songs tear away pretense, remember friends gone too soon and reflect on broken dreams. At its core, Blood Banks music celebrates survival.</q>

			<!-- Full article -->

			<!--Blood Banks songs stand in the face of the past while moving towards a future that so many of their beloved never saw. Lessons learned and gratitude; living for tomorrow through the lens of yesterday, and trying to make sense of it all. These are the themes of Blood Banks music.

			Their newest EP, Dear Tomorrow, was engineered and mixed by Jeremy Tappero at Little Red Light in St. Paul, MN and mastered by Matt Allison at Atlas in Chicago, IL. The six songs that comprise Dear Tomorrow are influenced by a myriad of styles, including punk rock, alt-country and their baseline of rock n’ roll.

			Lyrically, Dear Tomorrow is a personal catharsis, so much so that they put the bassist’s mom on the cover. Whether a hooky punk tune or a rhythm driven rock song, the reality of moving forward and the realization that “life is not what we once thought” is omnipresent. Blood Banks never asked to be here, and probably never thought they would be here, but they are and they are writing some amazing rock songs.

			Rawness and reflection defines Blood Banks. With sadness seeping into even the highest of moments, maturity and hope are what ends up splitting the seams. This band is looking back and trying to make sense of today. And with every chorus, crash and chord, they’re teaching us how to “Be Alive”.
